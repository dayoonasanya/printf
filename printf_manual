This manual page explains the function `_printf`, which is used for formatted output conversion. It is part of the `"main.h"` header file and is responsible for printing to the standard output based on the specified format string. The return value indicates the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte, and negative values signal an output error.

The format string may contain directives and conversion specifications, the latter being introduced by the `%` character. Corresponding arguments are required for each conversion specifier. Conversion specifiers include options for various data types, such as characters, strings, and different number representations (e.g., decimal, octal, hexadecimal, binary).

Additionally, the manual provides examples and references to related functions and resources. If any bugs are discovered, users are encouraged to report them to specific GitHub repositories. The authors are Adedayo A. Onasanya and Oluwatoyosi Oreniyi.
